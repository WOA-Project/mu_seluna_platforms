# Aarch64 Secure Boot Defaults

This external dependency contains the default values suggested by microsoft the KEK, DB, and DBX UEFI variables.

Additionally, it contains an optional shared PK certificate that may be used as the root of trust for the system.
The shared PK certificate is an offering from Microsoft. Instead of a original equipment manufacturer (OEM)
managed PK, an OEM may choose to use the shared PK certificate managed by Microsoft. Partically, this may be
useful as default on non production code provided to an OEM by an indenpendent vendor (IV).

1. The PK (Platform Key) is a single certificate that is the root of trust for the system. This certificate is used
    to verify the KEK.
2. The KEK (Key Exchange Key) is a list of certificates that verify the signature of other keys attempting to update
   the DB and DBX.
3. The DB (Signature Database) is a list of certificates that verify the signature of a binary attempting to execute
   on the system.
4. The DBX (Forbidden Signature Database) is a list of signatures that are forbidden from executing on the system.

Please review [Microsoft's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/windows-secure-boot-key-creation-and-management-guidance?view=windows-11#15-keys-required-for-secure-boot-on-all-pcs)
for more information on key requirements if appending to the defaults provided in this external dependency.
